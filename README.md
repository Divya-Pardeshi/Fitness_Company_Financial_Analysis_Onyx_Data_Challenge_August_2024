It provides an in-depth analysis of the financial performance of a sporting goods manufacturer, focusing on key financial metrics such as revenue, expenses, and profitability ratios.

## Project Overview

## Key Insights:
**1.Revenue Performance:**
- The total revenue for the year is $17.56M, with a gross profit of $10.85M and a net profit of $4.31M.
- The Sports Equipment line leads revenue generation, accounting for 50.73% of total sales.
- Nutrition & Food Supplements lags behind with just 10.50% of total revenue, signaling an underperforming segment.

**2.Profitability:**
- Sportswear emerged as the most profitable line with a Net Profit Margin of 44.25% and an EBIT Margin of 49.83%.
- In contrast, the Nutrition & Food Supplements line experienced losses, reflecting a Net Profit Margin of -24.83%, making it a critical area for strategic improvement.

**3.Expense Distribution:**
- The top three operational expenses (OPEX) across all business lines were Payroll, Equipment, and Marketing.
- The Nutrition & Food Supplements line had the highest OPEX Ratio at 58.78%, while Sports Equipment and Sportswear followed with 22.09% and 19.12% respectively.

**4.Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**
- Sports Equipment had the highest COGS at $3.67M, which impacted its overall margins despite high sales performance.
- Focusing on reducing labor and material costs in this business line could enhance its profitability.

**5. Gross Profit Margins:**
- The company's average Gross Profit Margin was 61.76% across all business lines.
- Sportswear stood out with the highest Gross Profit Margin of 70.34%, demonstrating significant efficiency in managing its cost structure while Sports Equipment had the second highest Gross Profit Margin of 58.69%.

**Recommendations:**

**1.Optimize Nutrition & Food Supplements:**
- Immediate attention should be given to reversing the losses in this segment. Reducing the OPEX Ratio (currently 71.65%) and enhancing marketing strategies or product offerings are key to improving profitability.

**2.Cost Control in Sports Equipment:**
- While the Sports Equipment line boasts high sales, reducing its COGS—particularly labor and material costs—will improve margins. Investments in efficient production processes could help reduce costs.

**3.Streamline Operational Costs:**
- With significant contributions to OPEX from Payroll, Equipment, and Marketing, exploring automation or outsourcing options could lead to cost reductions and improved margins across all business lines.

**4.Leverage Sportswear's Profitability:**
- Given the high profitability of the Sportswear line, further investment into expanding product lines or entering new geographic markets could provide greater returns and fuel overall company growth.

**5.Enhance Marketing for High ROI:**
- With Marketing already being a major expense category, optimizing marketing strategies by focusing on channels with the highest return on investment could drive sustained revenue growth without increasing costs.
